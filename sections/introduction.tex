\section{Introduction}
\label{s:introduction}

Blockchains are being used with increasing frequency, and for increasingly
diverse purposes. This had led to scaling concerns, as clients must keep
abreast of a large number of transactions, many of which are will not be
directly relevant to them. Many exciting protocol-level efforts to assuage
these concerns. The \oscoin{} architecture, however, emphasizes an additional,
\textit{semantic} level of sharding. Rather than a single chain, \oscoin{}
allows for an indefinite number of different chains, each serving different
purposes -- such as keeping track of a particular repository, of the outcome of
a vote, or of global financial transactions. In general, participants need not
sync chains which are not of interest to them, saving considerable space,
computation, and network usage.

Since the purpose of chains may be quite specific, we would like to be
able to precisely specify what sorts of transactions are allowed on it,
optimizing syntax for those use-cases. In essence, we want
\textit{domain-specific languages for domain-specific chains}. At the same
time, the interpretation of these domain-specific languages (DSLs) should be
accesible to anyone.

We propose a programming model, embodied in the language \rad, for defining the
semantics of, expressing transactions in, and scripting, chains.

\subsection{Context}

\subsection{Desiderata}

In order for consensus to be achievable, there must be agreement among
participants on the meaning and validity of blocks and transactions. Seen from
the perspective of programming languages, the meaning of an expression or
declaration must be the same for all users. This leads naturally to a
\textit{pure} programming language - one which side-effects are disallowed.
