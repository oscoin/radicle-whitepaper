\section{Sample Programs and Chains}

In this section, we develop a better sense for the language and its
applications by considering sample programs.

\subsection{Self-amending key-value store}

In Section \ref{s:language}, we defined a simple key-value store language. It
was not, however, an \emph{amendable} one---once defined, it was impossible to
change the semantics of the running system. For short-lived chains with a narrow
purpose, this might be satisfactory. For long-lived chains, the participants
ideas on the purpose of the chain may morph over time. Forking to a new chain is
an option, but this is not ideal for two reasons:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Concensus on the purpose and semantics of the new chain must be acheived
    ``of chain''.
  \item Participants must agree on the process and logistics of migrating to a
    new chain, how to decide from which block this takes place, etc.
\end{itemize}
In radicle this can all take place in-chain, by updating the eval function.

\input{out/kv1.rad-tex}

Note that in this case, the new evaluation function that is instantiated as a
result of a an \texttt{update} command, is the result of evaluating an
expression with the original \texttt{eval} function, because of the hyperstatic
environments. Thus, in this case, no tower of interpreters is formed. Instead,
we are swapping out one eval for another.

\subsection{Updatable state-machine}

Most chains will operate simple state machines with state $S$, inputs $I$ and
transitions governed by a function
\[
t \colon S \times I \to S.
\]

During the lifetime of the chain, participants may decide to modify the
state-machine in some way. The target state machine they have in mind is
specified by states $S'$, inputs $I'$ and transition function $t' \colon S'
\times I' \to S'$. In order for the old-state to be preserved they must also
choose a way to map the old state into the new format, with a function $f \colon
S \to S'$.

In order to acheive this, we define a chain that accepts two sorts of inputs:
\emph{basic inputs}:
\[
\mathtt{(basic} \ s), \quad s \in S
\]
and \emph{meta-inputs}:
\[
\mathtt{(meta} \ s), \quad s \in S
\]
which are messages the participants use to coordinate in choosing a new
transition function. All basic-inputs are simply handled by $t$ to update the
current state. The meta-inputs $\bar I$ are handled by a function
\[
m \colon \bar S \times S \times \bar I \to \bar S + V
\]
which modifies the meta-state $\bar S$ of the chain, while also having read-only
access to the state $S$. When $m$ produces a value in the right summand, this is
an expression which is evaluated to a dictionary containing $f$, $t'$ and
possibly $m'$. If only $f$ and $t'$ are present, the state is translated to the
new format with $f$, and the new state machine operated by $t'$ starts accepting
new basic inputs. If $m'$ is also provided, then the protocol for redefinition
of the state-machine is also updated.

Using this higher-order function we can now demonstrate several interesting
examples of chains:
\begin{itemize}
\item Issue chain, only person who opened issue and maintainers can close, only
  maintainers can update the transition function.
\item Ultimate example: chain managing a repo. The set of maintainers is
  maintained in a config file in master branch. only maintainers can accept PRs
  to master. Only maintainers can vote on new transition functions. This means
  that the function $m$ reads not only from the vote state $\bar S$ but also the
  basic state $S$ (i.e. the source code under version control).
\item etc.
\end{itemize}
