\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    Over the last few decades, with the emergence of open-source software,
    we've experienced an unprecedented acceleration in the development of our
    digital infrastructure, one that has become a new commons -- a public good
    we are now collectively responsible for. But we are all familiar with cases
    like Heartbleed, with developer burn-out, with projects acquired by
    ill-incentivized or incompetent parties. Today, many valuable open-source
    software projects are unable to define themselves in traditional market
    terms, while others find it incompatible with their ethics and struggle
    without financial support. Oscoin is a proposed solution to this problem
    which leverages technology and mechanisms pioneered by early
    crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.  In a network based
    economy, value should be distributed transparently towards the members who
    contribute value to the network, instead of being captured by a few.  We
    believe that crypto-economies are a means of creating financially
    sustainable decentralized communities.
